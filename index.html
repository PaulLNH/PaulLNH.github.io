    <!-- About me text -->
    <p>My name is Paul Laird, I’m a husband to a phenomenal wife, father of three awesome children, the sole financial provider
      for my family, and I just quit my corporate job. This might seem absurd but hear me out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m also an outdoors enthusiast, entrepreneur, and web developer. I love being outdoors and staying active, something
      my desk job would never allow. I find businesses fascinating! I’ve created a couple small businesses myself and it’s
      something I truly enjoy. Being creative and implementing a variety of business systems is not something I had the freedom
      to do locked in my office. It was time to break up with that oppressive relationship I called a job. I didn’t walk
      away from the paycheck, but rather I opened the door to my own creativity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You see, to me success is measured by the lives I impact, the experiences I share and the memories that are created.
      That is why I quit my job, to help people just like you.</p>
